This is actually a collection of programs that use/implement domain
specific languages or lightweight/embedded domain specific languages.

It just so happens that Atom is a very good one, and I'm using an Arduino
board for many of these. Don't be surprised to see things discussing stuff
that doesn't relate to Atom or Arduinos!
